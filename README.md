What if  "Fitter Happier" was recorded in 2013?
===============================================

Radiohead recorded "Fitter Happier" back around 1996. The voice was done with Macintosh Text to Speech.
Today the voice would likely be Siri. What would that sound like?


Have Siri Speak the Song
------------------------
- Siri is really Samantha (or close enough anyway), but Samantha doesn't come installed by default, so open up System Preferences, search on Text-to-Speech
- Click on the System Voice menu, and choose "Customize"
- Check the box for "Samantha", and click "OK", and agree to download the voice
- Either clone this repository or simply download the lyrics file
- Then, in Terminal, type: `say -f fitter_happier_formatted.txt -v Samantha`- 


Pull Requests Welcome
---------------------

I threw this together fast, so surely there are typos in the lyrics, and formatting/punctuation can be added so that Siri speaks the song with a similar cadence of the original song. So please fork and improve! Also, if anyone has the audio only portion of the song, it would be cool to play it while having Siri speak the lyrics.

Enjoy!
